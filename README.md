## Text Editors/IDE's
For normal text i usually use the system default notepad but i decided to use CLI based
text editors like vim or nano to use the keyboard more, which is really good for writing, for IDE's depending on the programming language i pick an IDE or sometimes i just use Visual Studio Code and download plugins for the language support, i also write a lot of my notes in markdown i use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but now i do that in visual studio code using some plugins to view markdown, also started using [notion](https://www.notion.so/).
