## Text Editors/IDE's
For normal text i usually use the system default notepad but i decided to use CLI based
text editors like vim or nano to use the keyboard more, which is really good for writing, for IDE's depending on the programming language i pick an IDE or sometimes i just use Visual Studio Code and download plugins for the language support.
